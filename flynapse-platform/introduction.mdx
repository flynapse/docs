## Core AI Copilots

### ‚úàÔ∏è MRO Co-Pilot
**Purpose**: Enable airline/MRO engineers to interact with complex technical documentation through conversational AI

The MRO Co-Pilot helps engineers quickly find maintenance procedures, troubleshooting steps, and technical specifications. Ask questions like "How do I remove a thrust reverser on an A320?" and get step-by-step guidance with exact document references.

**What you can do**:
- Search across AMM, SB, IPC, and AD documents
- Filter by aircraft type (A320, B737, etc.) and document type
- Get AI summaries of complex procedures
- View documents with intelligent page highlighting
- Add comments and collaborate with your team

### ‚úàÔ∏è Pilot Co-Pilot
**Purpose**: Empower flight crews with instant access to operational procedures and emergency protocols

The Pilot Co-Pilot provides flight crews with intelligent access to FCOM (Flight Crew Operating Manual) and QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) documentation. Ask questions like "What's the procedure for engine failure during takeoff?" and get immediate access to the exact procedures, checklists, and emergency protocols you need.

**What you can do**:
- Search across FCOM and QRH documents for procedures and checklists
- Filter by document type for precise results
- Get step-by-step guidance for normal and emergency procedures
- Access quick reference checklists for critical situations
- Collaborate with your crew by sharing procedures and adding notes
