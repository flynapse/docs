## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No documents found"**
- **Cause**: Your question might be too specific or use uncommon terms
- **Solution**: Try broader terms or different wording
- **Example**: Instead of "thrust reverser deployment mechanism," try "thrust reverser"

**"Results don't match what I need"**
- **Cause**: You might need to use filters or be more specific
- **Solution**: Apply document type and aircraft filters
- **Example**: Filter to "AMM" and "A320" for maintenance procedures

**"AI response seems incomplete"**
- **Cause**: The AI might need more context
- **Solution**: Ask follow-up questions or request more details
- **Example**: "Can you provide more details about the safety precautions?"

**"I can't see the documents I need"**
- **Cause**: You might not have access to certain document types
- **Solution**: Contact your administrator about document access
- **Prevention**: Check your account settings for available document types
