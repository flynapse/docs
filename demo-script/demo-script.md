### Script
**"Watch how Flynapse AI transforms aviation operations. Instead of searching through 35,000-page AMMs, engineers simply ask questions in plain English. 'How do I start an engine?' The AI instantly searches through all relevant documents and presents the most accurate procedures with specific page references.**

**Here's what makes it powerful: Engineers can filter by document type - AMMs, Service Bulletins, Airworthiness Directives, or Illustrated Parts Catalogs. They can specify aircraft types - currently Boeing 737, with more aircraft types coming soon. The AI understands aviation terminology and context, so it knows exactly what you're looking for.**

**When you get results, you can select specific documents to view them directly. The AI opens the document to the exact page with the relevant procedure highlighted. You can add comments - both public for your team and private for personal notes. This creates a knowledge layer where everyone can see shared insights and build collective expertise.**

**The system learns from your team's feedback and improves over time. Every interaction makes it smarter and more accurate for your specific maintenance procedures. This eliminates the need to navigate through bulky documents - users interact directly with a chat-based layer that provides consistent answers and enables public notes on document sections, making them visible to everyone."**
