### Alternative Script Variations

#### Version 1 (Concise - 25 seconds)
**"Why can't ChatGPT be your enterprise answer? ChatGPT has generic intelligence, not aviation-specific knowledge. It's Q&A only with no workflow integration. It's pre-trained on old data and cannot connect to live operational data. Every conversation is isolated with no organizational memory.**

**Flynapse AI is purpose-built for aviation. It understands AMMs, SBs, ADs, and IPC terminology. It provides contextual understanding and enables real-time collaboration. The results: 80% reduction in search time, 95% accuracy, and 60% faster maintenance completion."**

#### Version 2 (Detailed - 30 seconds)
**"Why can't ChatGPT be your enterprise answer? ChatGPT has generic intelligence, not aviation-specific knowledge. It's not trained on critical aviation use cases like MRO, operations control, or crew workflows. It's Q&A only with no workflow integration - it can't embed into airline systems, task cards, shift operations, or compliance flows.**

**ChatGPT is pre-trained on old data and cannot connect to live operational data, airline manuals, or regulatory updates. It lacks a custom knowledge layer optimized for aviation. Every conversation is isolated with no organizational memory - no shared enterprise knowledge layer, no safety or compliance traceability.**

**Flynapse AI is purpose-built for aviation. It understands AMMs, SBs, ADs, and IPC terminology. It provides contextual understanding, not just keyword matching. It enables real-time collaboration with your team through comments and sharing. The results speak for themselves: 80% reduction in search time, 95% accuracy in finding relevant procedures, and 60% faster maintenance completion."**

#### Version 3 (Problem-Focused - 28 seconds)
**"ChatGPT can't be your enterprise answer because it's generic intelligence, not aviation-specific. It's Q&A only with no workflow integration into airline systems. It's pre-trained on old data and cannot connect to live operational data. Every conversation is isolated with no organizational memory.**

**Flynapse AI solves these problems. It's purpose-built for aviation with contextual understanding of AMMs, SBs, ADs, and IPCs. It enables real-time collaboration and provides organizational memory. The results: 80% reduction in search time, 95% accuracy, and 60% faster maintenance completion."**
