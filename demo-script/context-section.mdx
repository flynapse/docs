# Context Section (15-30 seconds)

## Visual Elements
- **Scene**: Busy aviation operations environment with document-heavy workflows
- **Focus**: Teams overwhelmed by massive documentation, manual cross-referencing, and operational delays
- **Problem visualization**: Multiple screens showing thick manuals, PDFs, frustrated team members, time passing

## Script
**"Every day, aviation teams face the same challenges. Engineers search through massive technical documentation - AMMs with 35,000 pages, Service Bulletins with 10,000 pages, and Airworthiness Directives scattered across multiple sources. Manual cross-referencing between different document sources takes hours. This document overhead creates operational delays, errors, and costly aircraft downtime - while strict regulatory oversight demands perfect accuracy and compliance."**

## Key Points to Emphasize
- **Documentation Burden**: Massive technical documentation - AMMs with 35,000 pages, Service Bulletins with 10,000 pages, Airworthiness Directives scattered across multiple sources
- **Manual Cross-Referencing**: Hours spent manually cross-referencing between different document sources
- **Operational Impact**: Delays, errors, costly aircraft downtime
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Strict oversight demanding perfect accuracy and compliance
- **Business Impact**: Financial losses from operational inefficiencies
